## ngFlow

An angular module to create control flow and data flow diagrams

## Difference between control flow and data flow

## Usage

## Roadmap

[X] Update to angular 7
[X] Add a library using the `angular-cli`; `ng generate library ngflow`; The project appears unders `projects`. This will need to be built before use
[] Use the library in a demo 
I didn't add the prefix so all the library components were generated with the lib prefix. To delete it: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50243023/how-to-remove-a-created-library-in-angular6; 
`public_api.ts` is the entry file. This exports everything from the library that'll be public.
